            <p><strong>Boulder Farm</strong></p>

			<p>The <strong>Boulder Farm</strong> is located in <strong>Greyoll's Dragonbarrow</strong>, a high-level area in the northern part of <strong>Caelid</strong>. It can be accessed from the <strong>Lenne's Rise Site of Grace</strong>, located southeast of the <strong>Dragonbarrow West Site of Grace</strong>.</p>

			<p>To start the farming process, first rest at the <strong>Lenne's Rise Site of Grace</strong> to reset your spawn point. Take time to heal up if you've taken damage from enemies or traps along the way. From the Site of Grace, follow the path that leads beneath a bridge you've avoided earlier. This path takes you directly to the boulder farming area.</p>

				<p><strong>Bird Farm</strong></p>

				<p>The <strong>Bird Farm</strong> is an efficient rune farming method located near the <strong>Palace Approach Ledge-Road Site of Grace</strong> in the <strong>Mohgwyn Palace</strong> area, which is part of the subterranean Siofra River region.</p>
				
				<p>This farming method utilizes a giant bird found in the blood-filled lake, which can be made to fall off a cliff using a bow and arrows. Once defeated, the bird rewards players with approximately 11,000 runes, making it an excellent source of quick runes. The process is repeatable, with the player needing only to rest at the nearby Site of Grace to respawn the bird and continue farming.</p>

				<p><strong>Cliff Farm</strong></p>
				
				<p>The <strong>Cliff Farm</strong> at <strong>Mohgwyn Palace</strong> offers an unconventional method for rune farming by utilizing the game's map-loading mechanics. Players can jump from the cliffs surrounding the palace and perform continuous sword swings to despawn the area, resulting in the death of all nearby enemies.</p>
			
				<p>This farming technique grants players a significant number of runes for minimal effort. However, the method requires quick reflexes and precise timing to teleport to a nearby Site of Grace before the runes are lost. With practice, the Cliff Farm provides a highly efficient and repeatable method of farming runes.</p>
